Blue Yonder CSV to XML converter
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blue-yonder/di-csv2xml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blue-yonder/di-csv2xml)

This tool is intended to convert a `.csv` file into an `.xml` file ready to be sent to the
Blue Yonder Supply and Demand API. This tool has no schema information and therefore does not
perform any validation besides checking for valid `UTF8` encoding.

Installation
------------

You can [download a binary executable](https://github.com/blue-yonder/di-csv2xml/releases) (for
64Bit OS-X, Windows and Linux) or build it yourself using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blue-yonder/di-csv2xml.git
cd di-csv2xml
cargo build --release
```

You will find the executable in the `.\target\release\` directory.

You can install cargo from [here](https://rustup.rs) if it is not installed.

Usage
-----

```bash
di-csv2xml Category -i input.csv -o output.xml
```

converts this `input.csv` file

```csv
A,B,C,D
1,2,3,4
5,6,7,8
```

into this `output.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Category>
    <Record>
        <A>1</A>
        <B>2</B>
        <C>3</C>
        <D>4</D>
    </Record>
    <Record>
        <A>5</A>
        <B>6</B>
        <C>7</C>
        <D>8</D>
    </Record>
</Category>
```

Each line of the `input.csv` file is transformed into a separate XML-record. These are globally
embedded into a root-tag structure specified by the parameter `Category`.

Customer extensions are supported via the `CUEX_` prefix.

```csv
A,CUEX_B,C,CUEX_D
1,2,3,4
```

becomes

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Category>
    <Record>
        <A>1</A>
        <C>3</C>
        <CustomerExtensions>
            <B>2</B>
            <D>4</D>
        </CustomerExtensions>
    </Record>
</Category>
```

For more information, please use `di-csv2xml --help`.

As this tool does not provide any schema validation, it is important to note that you get what you typed.
Any typo in the parameter `category` or the header column of the csv-file is directly translated into the
dedicated XML-tag, leading to potential errors when attempting to process the XML-file further.
